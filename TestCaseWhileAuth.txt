When authenticating to a VM, you can create test cases to verify various aspects of the VM's functionality and configuration. Here are some examples of test cases you can apply while authenticated to a VM:

Connectivity Test:

Verify that you can SSH into the VM successfully.
Check if essential services like SSH, web server, database server, etc., are running and responsive.
User Account Management:

Ensure that user accounts are correctly configured.
Test user authentication and authorization.
Verify the ability to add, modify, and delete user accounts.
File System and Permissions:

Check the file system for integrity and available disk space.
Verify file and directory permissions.
Ensure that sensitive files are properly secured.
Software and Package Management:

Test the installation and removal of software packages.
Check for software updates and apply them.
Verify that the required software and libraries are installed.
Backup and Restore:

Test the backup and restore procedures to ensure data recovery.
Verify that backups are stored in a safe location and can be restored successfully.
Performance Testing:

Measure system performance using tools like top, vmstat, or custom scripts.
Check CPU, memory, and disk usage under various loads.
Network Configuration:

Validate network settings, including IP addresses, DNS, and routing.
Test network connectivity to external resources.
Security:

Perform security scans and vulnerability assessments.
Check for open ports and services that should not be running.
Verify firewall rules and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
Services and Daemons:

Test the start, stop, and restart of services and daemons.
Ensure that critical services are automatically started on boot.
Logging and Monitoring:

Verify that logs are generated and stored correctly.
Test log rotation and retention policies.
Set up alerts and notifications for critical events.
Custom Application Testing:

If your VM hosts custom applications, create test cases to verify their functionality.
Test application-specific features and workflows.
High Availability and Redundancy:

If applicable, test failover and redundancy mechanisms.
Ensure that the VM can withstand hardware or software failures.
Data Integrity and Data Loss Prevention:

Test data integrity checks and data loss prevention mechanisms.
Compliance Testing:

Ensure that the VM complies with security standards and regulatory requirements.
Documentation Review:

Verify that documentation, including configuration files and system documentation, is accurate and up-to-date.
